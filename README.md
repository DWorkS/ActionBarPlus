ActionBarPlus
==========

Library Project improvements to ActionBarCompat.

## Quick Start

Volley is available as an AAR, so you just need to add the following dependency to your `build.gradle`.
```
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
}
...

dependencies {
     compile 'dev.dworks.libs:actionbarplus:+'
}
...
```
